A very simple CraftBukkit server plugin created to change the art in paintings every 5 seconds. 
Bugs:
Paintings are invincible - Painting.setArt() is called even after painting is destroyed, painting is recreated.
If block behind paining is destroyed, painting will not be destroyed until art is changed again.
